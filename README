Benchpress is a WordPress installation and auditing tool focused on securing the application.

To use, read the getopts assignments and use appropriate flags.

Currently, benchpress only does a basic install with a few tweaks to remove useless extras and enable some security features. Planned features prior to breaking it into more useful modules are some adjustments to functions.php in the packaged theme, specify an install directory on the server (currently assumes whatever PWD is), move wp-content and wp-includes, and nginx/apache htaccess and mod_rewrite support.
